# Codebase Summary

## Key Components and Their Interactions
- **agent**: Core functionality implementation
- **client**: Frontend application
- **packages**: Modular plugins and adapters
- **docs**: Documentation system
- **tests**: Testing infrastructure

### MCP Servers

#### Memory MCP Server
The memory MCP server provides essential knowledge graph management capabilities that support:
- Entity and relationship creation
- Observation management
- Knowledge graph search and retrieval
- Structured memory for context and reasoning

#### Filesystem MCP Server
The filesystem MCP server provides robust file system operations including:
- File and directory management
- Content reading and writing
- File metadata operations
- Search and pattern matching
- Directory tree navigation

## Data Flow
1. Client makes requests to agent
2. Agent processes requests using appropriate plugins
3. Plugins interact with external services
4. Results are returned through agent to client

## External Dependencies
- TypeScript: Language and type system
- React: Frontend framework
- Node.js: Runtime environment
- pnpm: Package management
- Jest: Testing framework
- SQLite: Database adapter located at /root/Documents/Cline/MCP/sqlite-server

## Environment Documentation
- See environment.md for detailed environment setup and configuration

## Recent Significant Changes
- Established documentation structure
- Defined technology stack
- Created initial project roadmap
- Fixed memory server module resolution error by:
  - Updating tsconfig.json to use CommonJS modules
  - Rebuilding the server with proper module configuration

## User Feedback Integration
- Documentation structure created based on user instructions
- Technology choices aligned with user preferences
- Workflow processes established for efficient development
